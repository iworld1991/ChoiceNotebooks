    "$\\rho^{-1}$ stands for the elasticity of intertemporal subsitution. Although the rise of interest rate will lead consumers to **substitute** current consumption to future consumption, it does not necessarily result in a higher saving rate. Besides subsititution effect, there is also **income effect**. With higher interest rate, substitution effects reduces current consumption relative to future consumption because it makes consumption today more expensive. In the same time, however, income effects tend to increase current consumption as given amount of saving would earn more interest income in the second period. \n",

    "(2) As $0 < \\rho <1,\\frac{\\partial s_1}{\\partial R}  > 0$. Substitution effects dominate income effects. Interest rate rise leads to shift of consumption from period one to period two, thus **increasing saving** in period one. \n",
    "\n",
    "(3) As $\\rho = 1,\\frac{\\partial s_1}{\\partial R}  = 0$ Elasticity of intertemporal substitution is one, implying the consumers are indifferent to same amount of current consumption versus future consumption. Substitution effects and income effects cancel out. Therefore, interest rate change **does not change saving**. \n",

    "(5) As $\\rho \\rightarrow \\infty,\\frac{\\partial s_1}{\\partial R}  < 0, \\frac{\\partial s_1}{\\partial R} \\rightarrow \\frac{-1}{R^2 +R + 1}$ Also, from Euler equation, we know $\\frac{c_2}{c_1} = (R\\beta)^{\\frac{1}{\\rho}} \\rightarrow (R\\beta)^0 =1 \\Leftrightarrow c_2 =c_1$. This is the extreme case of zero elasticitiy of substitution ($\\rho^{-1} \\rightarrow 0$). The consumers do not adjust current consumption relative to future consumption. Therefore there are only income effects but not substitution effects. An interest rate rise increases capital income in the second period, so the consumers only allocate evenly the added income to two periods. \n"
